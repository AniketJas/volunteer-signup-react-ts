# 👐 Volunteer Signup MVP

A lightweight React + TypeScript web app designed to help local NGOs manage volunteer registrations for food donation drives and community service events.

This MVP focuses on simplifying the volunteer signup process and providing an easy way for NGO admins to view and manage signups — all without needing a backend.
